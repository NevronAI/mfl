MetisFL is a federated learning framework that allows developers to federate their machine learning workflows and train their models across distributed datasets without having to collect the data in a centralized location. Currently, the project is transitioning from a private, experimental version to a public, beta phase. We are actively encouraging developers, researchers and data scientists to experiment with the framework and contribute to the codebase.

MetisFL sprung up from the Information and Science Institute (ISI) in the University of Southern California (USC). It is backed by several years of Ph.D. and Post-Doctoral research and several publications in top-tier machine learning and system conferences. It is being developed with the following guiding principles in mind:

- **Scalability**: MetisFL is the only federated learning framework with the core controller infrastructure developed solely on C++. This allows for the system to scale and support up to 100K+ learners!

- **Speed**: The core operations at the controller as well as the controller-learner communication overhead has been optimized for efficiency. This allows MetisFL to achieve improvements of up to 1000x on the federation round time compared to other federated learning frameworks.

- **Efficiency and Flexibility**: MetisFL supports synchronous, semi-synchronous and asynchronous protocols. The different choices make our framework flexible enough to adapt to the needs of each use-case. Additionally, the support of fully asynchronous protocol makes MetisFL a highly efficient solution for use-cases with high heterogeneity on the compute/communication capabilities of the learners.

- **Strong Security**: MetisFL supports secure aggregations with fully homomorphic encryption using the [Palisade](https://gitlab.com/palisade/palisade-release) C++ cryptographic library. This ensures that the weights of the produced models remain private and secure in transit.

# Quickstart (coming soon)

As an introductory example to quickly demonstrate the MetisFL framework in practice, we will run the `Hello World` example of deep learning. To get started, install the MetisFL python library using pip:

```Bash
pip install metisfl
```

and then clone the repository on you local machine:

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/NevronAI/metisfl.git
```

Navigate to the `Tensorflow Quickstart` example under `examples/tensorflow-quickstart` and open up 5 terminals. In the first terminal, run the controller:

```Bash
python controller.py
```

This is going to startup the controller at port 50001 in the local machine. In the next 3 terminals run the learners:

```Bash
python learner.py -l ID
```

where `ID` is the unique identifier of the learner (1, 2, 3). This will startup 3 learners servers at ports 50002, 50003 and 50004 and the learners will connect to the controller and wait for the training task. Finally, in the last terminal run the driver:

```Bash
python driver.py
```

The driver will initiate the federated training, monitor the controller and learners and terminate the experiment once 5 federated rounds have been completed. Congratulations! You are now running your first federated learning experiment using MetisFL!

# Project Structure Overview

The project uses a unified codebase for both the Python and C++ code. The C++ modules, i.e., `controller` and `encryption`, have simple python bindings to expose their functionality to python code. The python bindings of the encryption module are directly used by the Learner for encrypting the weight before sending them to the controller.

# Architecture Overview

The architecture of MetisFL consists of three main components: the **Federation Controller**, the **Federation Learner** and the **Federation Driver**.

## Federation Controller

The Federation Controller is responsible for selecting and delegating training and evaluation tasks to the federation learners, for receiving, aggregating and storing the model updates and for storing the training logs and metadata. For the training tasks, the communication between the Learner and Controller is asynchronous at the protocol level. The Controller sends the training task to the Learner and the Learner sends back a simple acknowledgement of receiving the task. When the Learner finishes the task it sends the results back to the Controller by calling its `TrainDone` endpoint. For the evaluation tasks, the communication is synchronous at the protocol level, i.e., the Controller sends the evaluation task to the Learner and waits for the results using the same channel.

- Aggregation Rules: Federated Average, Federated Recency, Federated Stride, Secure Aggregation
- Schedulers: Synchronous, Semi-Synchronous, Asynchronous
- Security: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) using the [Palisade](https://gitlab.com/palisade/palisade-release) C++ cryptographic library
- Model Storage: In-memory, Redis (beta)
- Secure gRPC communication using SSL/TLS

## Federation Learner

The main abstraction of the client is called MetisFL Learner. The MetisFL Learner is responsible for training the model on the local dataset and communicating with the server. The Controller sends the evaluation task to the Learner and waits for the results using the same channel. The abstract class that defines the Learner can be found [here](https://github.com/NevronAI/metisfl/blob/main/metisfl/learner/learner.py). Each MetisFL learner must implement the following methods:

- `set_weights`: This method is called by the Controller to set the initial model weights. The Learner must implement the logic to set the weights of the local model.
- `get_weights`: This method is called by the Controller to get the current model weights. The Learner must implement the logic to return the weights of the local model.
- `train`: This method is called by the Controller to initiate the training task. The input to this method is the current model weights and a dictionary of hyperparameters. The Learner must implement the training logic and return the updated model weights to the Controller.
- `evaluate`: This method is called by the Controller to initiate the evaluation task. The Learner must implement the evaluation logic and return the evaluation metrics to the Controller.

## Federation Driver

The Driver orchestrates the training process by communicating with the Controller and the Learners. First, it initializes the model weights by requesting the initial values from a randomly selected learner and distributing to everyone else. Additionally, it monitors the federation for the termination signal(s) and shuts the learners/controller down once the signal is reached. Finally, it collects the training logs and metadata from the Controller and stores them in a local file.
